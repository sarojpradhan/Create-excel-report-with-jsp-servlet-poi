# Create-excel-report-with-jsp-servlet-poi
This project is the demonstration on how to create an excel report using Apache POI, a Java library that allows programmers to create, 
modify, and display MS Office files using Java programs. In this project, one JSP page is created in which a user can select a 
department from the dropdown list. When end-user clicks the Print button, the request is sent to the ExcelGenerator servlet. 
The staffs for some departments are already hardcoded in the program. The same logic can be applied to extract data if data has to 
be fetched from a database.

The needed POI jars are added in lib folder of the project. Additionally, it can be downloaded from the official Apache POI page.
